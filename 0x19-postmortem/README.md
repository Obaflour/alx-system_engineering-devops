##	Issue Summary:
- Duration: May 10, 2023, 9:00 AM - May 10, 2023, 11:30 AM (GMT +1)
- Impact: The web application experienced a complete service outage, resulting in a loss of functionality for all users. Users were unable to access the application or perform any actions during the outage.
###	Timeline:
- 9:00 AM: The issue was detected when the monitoring system triggered an alert for high response time.
- Actions taken: The operations team initiated an investigation by checking server logs and network connectivity.
Misleading investigation/debugging paths: Initially, the focus was on server capacity and network issues, leading to efforts in scaling servers and verifying network configurations.
- 10:00 AM: The incident was escalated to the development team for further analysis and troubleshooting.
- Actions taken: The development team performed a code review and identified a potential database issue.
- 11:00 AM: The incident was escalated to the database administration team for resolution.
- How the incident was resolved: The database administration team discovered a corrupted index in the database, causing query failures and overall service unavailability.
- Resolution: The corrupted index was repaired, and the database was optimized to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Root Cause and Resolution:
- Root Cause: The root cause of the issue was a corrupted index in the database, leading to query failures and the inability to serve requests properly.
- Resolution: The database administration team repaired the corrupted index, restoring the functionality of the application. Additionally, a comprehensive database optimization process was performed to prevent similar issues in the future.
- Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To improve and address the issue, the following tasks have been identified:
Implement regular database health checks and automated monitoring to detect and prevent index corruption.
Enhance logging and monitoring capabilities to provide more detailed insights during troubleshooting.
Establish a clear incident escalation and communication protocol to ensure timely collaboration between teams.
Conduct periodic code reviews and performance testing to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize database queries.
Implement a disaster recovery plan to mitigate the impact of similar incidents and ensure minimal downtime.
##	Conclusion:
The web stack outage was caused by a corrupted index in the database, resulting in service unavailability for all users. The incident was detected through monitoring alerts and resolved by repairing the index and optimizing the database. To prevent future occurrences, corrective measures have been identified and will be implemented, including regular health checks, enhanced monitoring, and improved incident response procedures. By addressing these measures, we aim to maintain a more stable and reliable web application for our users.
